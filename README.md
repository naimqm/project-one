# Project One:  Valid, Responsive-Ready HTML
***By: Na'im Muhammad - ITMD 361, Fall 2021 - Professor Karl Stolley***


Project One has been an absolute blast to work on! Working on this project as a Computer Science major has given me a completely different view of code. Before starting this class, I viewed frontend web development as something really simple and unexciting. Professor Stolley has managed to take something I previously knew to be *simple markup* and show me that it is truly an *art form*.

When I initially learned about these web technologies, I rushed through HTML and CSS and ran straight for the fancy, deceptive Javascript Frameworks with a very shoddy foundation. There was so much overlooked and the code behind any previous web project of mine was, well, *not at all semantic*.

## ยง1 - *"Valid, Well-Formed Semantic"* HTML
I was *start-of-ITMD-361* years old when I learned of such a concept. In my previous experience, HTML was just an ugly, cluttered language. I understood the concept of it being the "structure" of a webpage, but nothing more. There were so many tags that I thought were utterly useless because they didn't make something appear on the webpage.

This class has made me more conscientious of the importance of accessibility. There is still great inequity in the world when it comes to access to technology. Some people have impairments that require them to interact with devices in a way that's different from what many developers may be accustomed to. 

The presence and proper use of additional tags like `<section>` and `<article>` can make or break someone's user experience, despite their imperceptibly by traditional users.
